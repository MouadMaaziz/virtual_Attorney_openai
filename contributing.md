# Seeking Experienced Open Source Leader for Novel Medical AI Project 

I am looking for an experienced open source tech leader to drive a new medical AI project that I have developed as a proof of concept. The goal is to build an open community around this initiative and properly test and validate it through partnerships with universities, research institutions, and/or government organizations. 

The project uses GPT and a simple workflow automation to mimic medical intake, diagnosis, examination, and referral. It shows promise to streamline primary care and empower patients and clinicians with AI assistance. However, it requires extensive validation and should not be used clinically without oversight. 

That's where you come in. This will be a major open source undertaking, requiring an experienced leader who can:

- Connect with academics, researchers, clinicians to establish rigorous testing protocols
- Grow an open community on GitHub and drive collaboration  
- Guide the roadmap, software architecture and releases
- Promote ethical, safe AI practices in medicine
- Cultivate partnerships with institutions that can provide funding, resources and oversight

This is not a commercial endeavor. The project will be licensed openly. The goal is scientific progress and benefitting patients worldwide through accessible medical AI.

As the founder, I have done the initial software development and simulations. You would take over leadership of the open source community. This is a tremendous opportunity to spearhead an impactful and transformative open project in health tech. 

If you have led major open source projects, especially in AI or medicine, and are passionate about advancing healthcare, please get in touch! I would love to explore working together to ensure this technology progresses safely and for the public good.

Let me know if you would like any additional details on the project and proof of concept. Thanks for your interest!
