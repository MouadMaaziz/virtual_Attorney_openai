# SCENARIO BUILDING GUIDE

## BEST CASE SCENARIO:

- **CASE OUTCOME:**
  - The court grants the client sole custody of the children, recognizing the client's role as the primary caregiver and the ex-partner's inconsistent involvement.

- **KEY FACTORS:**
  - The client's detailed log of missed visitations by the ex-partner and the documented communication expressing concern about the impact on the children.
  - Statements from family members, friends, and teachers corroborating the client's role as the primary caregiver and the ex-partner's inconsistency.
  - The client's demonstrated focus on providing a stable and nurturing environment for the children.

- **STRATEGY EMPLOYED:**
  - The client's attorney effectively presents the evidence and argues that granting sole custody to the client is in the best interest of the children.

## WORST CASE SCENARIO:

- **CASE OUTCOME:**
  - The court denies the client's request for sole custody and maintains the current custody arrangement.

- **MITIGATING FACTORS:**
  - The court may perceive the ex-partner's missed visitations as a result of work commitments rather than neglect.
  - The court may consider the lack of any legal proceedings related to child welfare in the past as a positive factor for the ex-partner.

- **LESSONS LEARNED:**
  - The client may need to gather more compelling evidence to demonstrate the ex-partner's inconsistency and its impact on the children's well-being.

## TYPICAL OUTCOME:

- **AVERAGE CASE RESULT:**
  - The court may grant the client primary custody, with the ex-partner receiving visitation rights. This would recognize the client's role as the primary caregiver while still allowing the ex-partner to be involved in the children's lives.

- **COMMON CHALLENGES:**
  - Proving that the ex-partner's inconsistent involvement is detrimental to the children's well-being.
  - Balancing the court's desire to keep both parents involved in the children's lives with the client's desire for sole custody.

- **PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES:**
  - The client should continue to document instances of the ex-partner's inconsistency and its impact on the children.
  - The client should maintain open communication with the ex-partner about the children's well-being and document these discussions.

## ADVICE FOR CLIENT:

- **CLIENT GUIDANCE:**
  - Continue to gather evidence supporting your role as the primary caregiver and the ex-partner's inconsistent involvement.
  - Maintain a focus on the children's well-being in all discussions and proceedings.

- **COMMUNICATION STRATEGY:**
  - Keep all communication with the ex-partner respectful and focused on the children. Document all discussions related to the children's well-being and the ex-partner's involvement.

- **EXPECTATIONS MANAGEMENT:**
  - Understand that the court's primary concern is the best interest of the children, which often involves maintaining involvement from both parents. Be prepared for a potential outcome that includes visitation rights for the ex-partner.
