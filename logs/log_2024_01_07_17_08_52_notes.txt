# Client Intake Notes

## Client Information:
- Name: Mouad
- Location: Brazil
- Legal Issue: Heritage claim

## Case Details:
1. The client's father owned a business and property, which are now controlled by his two uncles following his father's death.
2. The father was murdered and did not leave a will.
3. The client's immediate surviving family includes himself and his mother.
4. Both the client and his mother are interested in claiming their share of the father's business and property.
5. The business is a sales company located in the USA.
6. The business was registered solely under the father's name, but the uncles were involved in most of the activities.
7. It is unclear whether there are any written agreements or contracts between the father and the uncles regarding their involvement in the business.

## Legal Points:
1. In the absence of a will, laws of intestacy apply, which typically means the inheritance goes to the spouse and children.
2. The business was registered in the USA, so US inheritance laws may apply.
3. The nature of the uncles' involvement in the business needs to be clarified, especially if there are any written agreements or contracts.

## Next Steps:
1. Determine the specifics of the uncles' involvement in the business.
2. Investigate whether there are any written agreements or contracts between the father and the uncles.
3. Consult with an attorney specializing in international inheritance law, particularly between Brazil and the USA.
4. Gather all necessary documents related to the business and property for legal review.
