# Legal Consultation Notes

## Client Information:
- The client's dog was killed during a procedure performed by a veterinary intern.
- The client claims that the intern was inexperienced and that they did not give consent for the intern to perform the procedure.

## Key Legal Points:

1. **Lack of Consent:** The client did not give consent for the intern to perform the procedure on their dog. This could potentially be a violation of the client's rights and may constitute negligence on the part of the veterinarian or the clinic.

2. **Misrepresentation:** The client alleges that the veterinarian lied about the intern's experience. However, there is currently no written documentation to support this claim.

3. **Lack of Documentation:** The clinic did not provide any written prognosis or medical records indicating that the dog had little chance of survival prior to the procedure. This could potentially be a violation of the client's rights to be fully informed about the risks and benefits of the procedure.

4. **Post-Incident Response:** It is unclear how the veterinarian or the clinic management responded to the incident after the procedure. Further information is needed to assess potential negligence or malpractice.

## Next Steps:

- Gather more information about the post-incident response from the veterinarian or the clinic management.
- Seek any possible evidence of misrepresentation about the intern's experience.
- Investigate the standard procedures for obtaining consent in veterinary practices to determine if there was a breach.
- Obtain any possible medical records or documentation related to the dog's health and the procedure.
- Consider seeking expert opinion on whether the intern's involvement could have led to the dog's death.
