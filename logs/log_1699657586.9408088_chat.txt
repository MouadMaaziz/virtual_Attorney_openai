CLIENT: I need to fill out my form of custody.

INTAKE: Sure, I can help guide you with that. To start, could you please tell me if this is for a new custody agreement or a modification of an existing one?

CLIENT: It's a new one.

INTAKE: Understood. Could you please specify whether you are seeking sole custody, joint custody, or some other arrangement?

CLIENT: I am seeking sole custody.

INTAKE: Thank you for the information. Could you please provide the reasons why you believe sole custody would be in the best interest of the child?

CLIENT: I seek sole custody to maintain the stability I've provided as the primary caregiver. My ex's unpredictable schedule and inconsistent involvement raise concerns about the children's well-being, and I aim to ensure their continued emotional and physical security.

INTAKE: Thank you for sharing that. Can you provide any specific instances or evidence that demonstrate your ex's unpredictable schedule and inconsistent involvement?

CLIENT: Certainly. There have been numerous instances where my ex missed scheduled visitations due to work commitments, affecting our children's routine. I've maintained a detailed log of these occurrences, including canceled events and last-minute changes, to illustrate the impact of their unpredictable schedule on our children's lives.

INTAKE: That's very helpful. Do you have any documented communication with your ex-partner about these missed visitations and the impact on your children? This could be in the form of emails, text messages, or letters.

CLIENT: Yes, I have a collection of emails and text messages exchanged with my ex-partner discussing the missed visitations and expressing my concerns about the impact on our children. These communications highlight the ongoing challenges and serve as additional evidence of their inconsistent involvement and the resulting disruption in our children's lives.

INTAKE: That's very useful. Do you have any witnesses who can corroborate your role as the primary caregiver and the inconsistency of your ex-partner's involvement? These could be family members, friends, or professionals like teachers or healthcare providers.

CLIENT: Yes, I have gathered statements from family members, friends, and teachers who have witnessed my consistent role as the primary caregiver and the irregular involvement of my ex-partner. These testimonials provide external validation of my commitment to our children's well-being and support my case for sole custody.

INTAKE: That's excellent. Now, have there been any instances of domestic violence, substance abuse, or any other serious issues that could affect the court's decision on custody?

CLIENT: No, there have been no instances of domestic violence or substance abuse in our relationship. My focus is solely on providing a stable and nurturing environment for our children, emphasizing their well-being in the custody proceedings.

INTAKE: That's good to hear. Lastly, have you or your ex-partner ever been involved in any legal proceedings related to child welfare, such as child neglect or abuse?
