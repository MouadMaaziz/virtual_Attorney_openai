# Legal Notes:

1. **Client's Issue:** The client's dog was killed during a procedure performed by an inexperienced intern at a veterinary clinic. The client did not give consent for the intern to perform the procedure.

2. **Misrepresentation:** The client alleges that the veterinary clinic lied about the intern's experience. However, there is no written communication or documentation to support this claim.

3. **Lack of Consent:** The client did not give consent for the intern to perform the procedure. This could potentially be a violation of the client's rights.

4. **Lack of Documentation:** The clinic did not provide any written prognosis or medical records indicating that the dog had little chance of survival prior to the procedure. This could potentially be a violation of the client's rights to information.

5. **Post-Incident Communication:** It is unclear whether the client has had any discussions with the veterinarian or the clinic management after the incident. The response of the clinic to the incident is not known.

6. **Next Steps:** The client may need to seek legal advice on potential claims for negligence, misrepresentation, and violation of rights. The client should also consider obtaining any available documentation or evidence related to the incident.
