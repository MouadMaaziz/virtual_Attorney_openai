1. STRATEGY FOR ESTABLISHING SOLE CUSTODY BASED ON PRIMARY CAREGIVER STATUS:
   - PRECEDENTS: In many jurisdictions, courts have favored the parent who has been the primary caregiver in custody disputes. Cases such as "Troxel v. Granville" (530 U.S. 57) have emphasized the importance of the primary caregiver's role in a child's life.
   - LEGAL CONTEXT: The "best interests of the child" standard is typically used in custody cases. Factors considered include the child's emotional ties to the parents, the parents' ability to provide a stable environment, and the continuity in the child's life.
   - EVIDENCE: The client's detailed log of instances where the ex-partner missed scheduled visitations and the documented communication discussing these instances can be used to demonstrate the ex-partner's inconsistent involvement. Statements from family members, friends, and teachers corroborating the client's role as the primary caregiver will also be beneficial.
   - CHALLENGES: The ex-partner may argue that their work commitments are temporary or have changed, allowing for more consistent involvement. They may also present evidence of their own to demonstrate their involvement in the children's lives.
   - STRATEGIC APPROACH: The client should continue to document instances of the ex-partner's inconsistent involvement and gather additional statements supporting their role as the primary caregiver. The client's attorney should emphasize the importance of stability and continuity in the children's lives in court proceedings.
   - ALTERNATIVES: If the ex-partner's involvement becomes more consistent, the client may need to consider a joint custody arrangement. However, the client's role as the primary caregiver should still be emphasized in negotiations.

2. STRATEGY FOR ESTABLISHING SOLE CUSTODY BASED ON THE EX-PARTNER'S UNPREDICTABLE SCHEDULE:
   - PRECEDENTS: In cases such as "In re Marriage of Carney" (24 Cal. 3d 725), the court has considered the parent's ability to provide a stable environment in determining custody.
   - LEGAL CONTEXT: The court will consider the impact of the ex-partner's unpredictable schedule on the children's well-being. The client's ability to provide a stable environment will be a key factor.
   - EVIDENCE: The client's log of missed visitations due to the ex-partner's work commitments and the documented communication discussing these instances can be used to demonstrate the impact of the ex-partner's unpredictable schedule.
   - CHALLENGES: The ex-partner may argue that their schedule has changed or that they can arrange for reliable childcare during their scheduled visitations.
   - STRATEGIC APPROACH: The client should continue to document instances of the ex-partner's unpredictable schedule disrupting the children's routine. The client's attorney should emphasize the importance of a stable environment for the children's well-being in court proceedings.
   - ALTERNATIVES: If the ex-partner's schedule becomes more predictable, the client may need to consider a joint custody arrangement. However, the client's ability to provide a stable environment should still be emphasized in negotiations.
