# Legal Case Notes

## Client Information:
- The client's pet dog died during a procedure conducted by a veterinary intern.
- The client claims that they did not give consent for the intern to perform the procedure.

## Incident Details:
- The procedure was performed by an intern with limited experience.
- The client alleges that the veterinary clinic misrepresented the intern's experience.
- The client was not provided with a prognosis or medical records indicating that the dog had little chance of survival prior to the procedure.

## Potential Legal Issues:
1. Lack of Informed Consent: The client did not give consent for the intern to perform the procedure. This could potentially be a violation of the client's rights.
2. Misrepresentation: The client alleges that the veterinary clinic lied about the intern's experience. If proven, this could constitute fraud or misrepresentation.
3. Negligence: If the intern's lack of experience and the clinic's failure to inform the client contributed to the dog's death, this could potentially be a case of professional negligence.

## Required Actions:
- Obtain any available documentation related to the procedure and the intern's qualifications.
- Investigate the standard procedures for obtaining consent in veterinary practices.
- Determine if there was a breach of duty of care by the veterinarian or the clinic.
- Explore potential avenues for compensation for the client's loss.
