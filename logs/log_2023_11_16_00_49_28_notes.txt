# Legal Consultation Notes

## Client Information:
- The client is seeking legal assistance to sue their boss.

## Incident Details:
- The client alleges that their boss physically assaulted them by slapping them.

## Next Steps:
- It is unclear whether the client has reported the incident to any authority. This needs to be clarified.
  - If not reported, advise the client to report the incident to their Human Resources department and/or the police, as physical assault is a serious matter.
  - If already reported, gather details about the response from the respective authority.

## Legal Considerations:
- The client's claim could potentially involve both civil and criminal law aspects, depending on the jurisdiction and the specifics of the incident.
- The client may have a claim for assault and battery, and possibly intentional infliction of emotional distress.
- If the client's employer failed to take appropriate action after being notified of the incident, there may also be a claim for negligent supervision or a hostile work environment.

## Additional Information Needed:
- More details about the incident, including the date, location, any witnesses, and any physical or emotional harm suffered.
- Whether the client has any evidence, such as medical reports, photographs, or witness statements.
- The client's employment details, such as their position, length of employment, and the size of the company.
- Any previous incidents or ongoing issues with the boss or the workplace environment.
