# Legal Consultation Notes

1. **Client's Objective**: The client seeks assistance in claiming their father's heritage.

2. **Existence of a Will**: It is unclear whether the client's father had a will. This information is crucial as it will determine the process of inheritance.

   - If a will exists, the client will need to initiate the probate process.
   - If there is no will, the client will have to follow the intestacy laws of their jurisdiction.

3. **Next Steps**: The attorney should inquire about the existence of a will and gather more information about the father's estate, including assets, debts, and other potential heirs.
